##### LEARNING DIARY, Back End MODULE

I set up a git repository and read the instructions for completing the course. I chose VS Code as my editor since I have used it before and have it set up with all the extensions. I watched the REST Intro video and learned what REST APIs are and how to use them.

I already had NodeJS installed, so I started writing the code right away.
